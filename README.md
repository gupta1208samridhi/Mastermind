# Overview

Mastermind is a classic code-breaking game where one player creates a secret code and the other player tries to guess within a set number of attempts. The code creator chooses a secret code consisting of a specified number of colors or symbols, with possible repetitions. The guesser makes a series of attempts to guess the correct code by selecting their own combination of colors or symbols. After each guess, the code creator provides feedback to the player. The guesser wins the game if they correctly guess the secret code within the allotted number of attempts.
